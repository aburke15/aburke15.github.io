                    <li>Pet Paradigm owners and stakeholders need a website that improves navigation and content clarity for
                        users, offers basic pet care advice for common pet types, enables users to easily contact the company
                        for

                    </li>
                    <li>Display company contact information, including phone number and email, at the top and bottom of each
                        page
                        for easy access.</li>
                    <li>Include a hover animation on the navigation bar, along with an audio response when clicked, to improve
                        interactive navigation.</li>

                        auditory feedback on submission, signaling success or failure. Unsuccessful submissions will trigger a

                        New content on a dedicated page would address care and maintenance for fresh and saltwater fish,
                        advocating for the use of water testing kits, detailing safe water chemical levels, and providing
                        access

                        New content could include information on habitat essentials (such as humidity and UV lighting), diet

                        and
                        common health indicators to monitor. The ability to consult a “Pexpert” on topics such as
